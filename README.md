# 🧠 AI Mood / Focus Tracker

A modern, lightweight **frontend-only web application** for tracking daily mood and focus levels, visualizing productivity trends, and receiving simple AI-style recommendations.

This project is built **without any frameworks** and is designed as a **portfolio-ready example** of clean Vanilla JavaScript architecture, UI/UX thinking, and incremental development with Git commits.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User selects:

   - **Mood** (happy / neutral / sad)
   - **Focus level** (1–10)

2. On clicking **Add Entry**:

   - Entry is saved to `localStorage`
   - History list updates
   - Chart re-renders with new data
   - AI advice updates based on mood

3. On page reload:

   - Stored data is restored automatically
   - Chart and history are re-rendered

## 📈 Progress Chart Explained

The **Progress Chart** visualizes the user's **focus level over time**.

Why it matters:

- Turns raw numbers into insights
- Helps detect productivity trends
- Builds foundation for future AI analytics

Without the chart → static tracker
With the chart → **behavior analysis tool**

## 🤖 AI Advice (Mocked)

The AI advice system is rule-based and simulates intelligent feedback:

| Mood    | Advice                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Happy   | Encourages deep work            |
| Neutral | Promotes consistency            |
| Sad     | Suggests rest and lighter tasks |

> This logic can later be replaced with a real AI model or API.
